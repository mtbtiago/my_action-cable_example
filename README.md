# My Action Cable Examble

Based upon Shophie DeBenetto's work
Also uses [action_cable_client gem](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/action_cable_client)

*ruby_client* folder contains a PoC to use a plain Ruby client from Linux and Windows.

I want to prove a Windows Ruby script can communicate by Action Cable with Rails server and bowser clients
